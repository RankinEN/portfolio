# portfolio
a portfolio of code that I have put written for personal use

I have put together this portfolio for the purposes of resumes and interviews. it contains examples of code that I have written
for various purposes, including code from other projects on my github profile.

here is a brief description of each of the code files included:

Loop Tournament: a program designed to take team names, put them in a list, and then take input from the user about two variables of
    each, at which point it will then use the random.randint(1,100) function to create a random number that is added to the multiple of
    those variables to determine a winner of a matchup between two of the previously input teams. this code is inteded to help with
    creating less predictable results in a collaborative fiction project I am working on.
